# Section.io - Goated OOP Project With Javascript Solution

This is a solution to the [Goated OOP Project With Javascript as seen on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDzVgSQUzEE). I am trying to improve my coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See Date, Time and Background Image display responsively. That is, date is always current, and background image reflects day or nice depending on time of day.  
- Text and Images to should be largely populated from Javascript Objects.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

1) Additional acquaintance using Objects. 
2) Populating text and images from Javascript (and not HTML or CSS)

### Continued development

Will increasingly take on increasingly complex OOP projects.    

### Useful resources

Stackoverflow, MDN Web Docs, w3schools, YouTube, Google
